# Tweaker-Plugin for Cura 2.3



The orientation plugin is a simple wrapper around the Tweaker. 

It allows you to quickly calculate and apply the best printable orientation directly from Cura.



The Tweaker (OrientationPlugin) can be found [here](https://github.com/nallath/CuraOrientationPlugin)


Thanks to Nallath for building the Plugin it!
